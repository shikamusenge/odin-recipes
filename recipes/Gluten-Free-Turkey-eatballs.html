        My mom developed this recipe after many attempts at gluten-free
        meatballs. We now have a delicious and healthy way to eat a food we
        love!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>¾ pound ground turkey</li>

        <li>½ pound chicken sausage, casings removed</li>

        <li>⅔ cup gluten-free bread crumbs</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>

        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps to prepare Gluten-Free Turkey Meatballs</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
          with parchment paper.
        </li>

        <li>
          Combine ground turkey, chicken sausage, bread crumbs, basil, milk,
          garlic, Parmesan cheese, kosher salt, and black pepper in a bowl; mix
          gently with a fork. Drop mixture, about 1 1/4-inch diameter per
          meatball, onto the prepared baking sheet using a spoon.
        </li>

        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through and lightly browned,
          about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
          should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
      </ol>
