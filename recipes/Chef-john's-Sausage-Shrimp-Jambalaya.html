        While shrimp jambalaya is really more of a thicker rice stew than a
        soup, it's one of those dishes that can be customized. Add more stock to
        easily make it into a soup recipe. Serve garnished with green onion.

      <h3>Steps to prepare Chef John's Sausage & Shrimp Jambalaya</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place butter and sausage in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook
          and stir until sausage begins to brown, 5 to 6 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>Stir in paprika, cumin, and cayenne; cook for 1 minute.</li>

        <li>
          Stir tomatoes, celery, green pepper, green onions, salt, and bay leaf
          into the sausage mixture.
        </li>

        <li>
          Add brown rice and stir to combine. Stir in chicken stock, bring it to
          a simmer, then turn heat to low. Cover and cook until rice is just
          tender, about 45 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
          Stir in shrimp, replace lid and cook until shrimp are cooked through,
          about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
